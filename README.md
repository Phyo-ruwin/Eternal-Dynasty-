This project is a Burmese name generator app that combines random name generation with Mahar Bote, a concept from Burmese astrology. It was developed as part of my graduation research in natural language processing. The project is currently in the developing stages and is undergoing design and editing. The backend concept is functional, generating names based on birthdays according to Mahar Bote.
